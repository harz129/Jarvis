# Jarvis
JARVIS is a Python-based desktop AI assistant built using PyQt, designed to function as a reliable, modular, and extensible personal assistant. Unlike web-based AI tools, JARVIS operates as a native desktop application, providing faster execution, improved privacy, and direct interaction with system-level resources.
